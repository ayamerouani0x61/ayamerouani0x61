👋 Hey there! I'm Aya, AI Developer 🧠 | Data Engineer ⚙️ | Full-Stack Web Dev 🧩 | Builder of AI Agents that *actually* think 🤖

💻 I turn code into intelligent systems, from fast, clean web apps to powerful ML pipelines and autonomous AI agents.

🚀 I work with:
- Python, FastAPI, Django, Next.js
- LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI, TensorFlow
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, GitHub Actions
- Render, Vercel, AWS (cloud is my playground)

🧪 I love mixing backend logic + clean UI + machine learning + real-world impact.

🛠️ Currently building: 
- AI-based football performance analysis 🏟️⚽  
- AI agents that automate workflows and support decision-making  
- Web tools that predict, recommend, and *learn*
- Health Care systems that helps, manage, and automate processes

🎯 Mission: Build systems that don’t just *run*, they *learn, adapt, and help*.
